# Daves_Garage_Tiki_Fire_Umbrella

This repo contains the code similar if not identical to the code shown in the video series from Dave's Garage. Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF2KJ6Gy3cZ7ynsp8s4tnqEFmY15CKhmH

I've done arduino/Atmel projects over a decade ago that included making my own arduino's from the Atmel328 chips and going into lower levels of EE. I started looking for alternative chips that had a bit more capability and stumped upon the ESP32.

While looking at data sheets and some example videos I stumbled upon Dave's garage. His videos are great from the fact that they teach you not only how to do things but the logic behind what you are doing and why with out going off the deep end. I wish the individually addressable RGB LEDs existed when I first started. Dave gives you a taste of what managing LEDs was like before these existed. There are other technical things that get hid like how led matrices work. For most projects you don't need to know that to make cool things with addressable LEDs.
