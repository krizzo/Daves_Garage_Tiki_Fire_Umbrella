# Episode 01 : LED basics

This code has 3 or more stages, it all depends how your mind works. I suggest watching the video from the beginning and trying to figure it out as Dave goes. I've included links below to the different sections of the video for quick reference.

I made comments in the code for each stage you just uncomment the code for the stage you're working on and comment all other stages, of course you can ignore the stage 3 function and global settings as they become noops.
